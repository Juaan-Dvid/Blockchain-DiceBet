DiceBet is a game build on blockchain
 
How does it work?
 
1. Download Metamask Wallet app and connect it with the DiceBet, then add Binance Smart Chain and set it up as your own network. You need to get BNB tokens in this free link . Take into account that the Metamask Wallet is a requirement to play Dice. Consider using Google Chrome for a better experience.
 
2. Go to the Buy & Sell tokens tab and buy JDM tokens to play
 
3. Enter the Dice tab and place the JDM amount you want to bet and then select a number from 1 to 6. The system will then generate a random number from 1 to 6. If the number you chose and the ramdom number selected by system are the same, you will win double the amount bet.
 
4. All transactions will be registered on the Binance Blockchain Testnet, so each time you do anything like buy, sell or bet tokens, you must approve that transaction in your Metamask Wallet to continue playing.
